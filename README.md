# Oracle Database (Step By Step):

Here you can find solution of Week-10: Q.no: 08



## Login to the System Database User :

##### *Default Username:  system & Password: system*


```bash
SQL> connect system; 

Enter password: system

Connected.....

```

## Creating New Database User & Password

##### *This command will help you create new user which contains fresh database*

```bash
  CREATE USER {banking_user} IDENTIFIED BY {password};
```
```bash
  GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO {banking_user};
```
```bash
  CONNECT {banking_user}
  Enter password: {password}
```

##### *You can also use the system database and create tables there but it will contains some predefined tables, constraints etc*


##  Creating TABLES:

##### *This command will help you create new tables*

```bash
CREATE TABLE BRANCH(branch_name VARCHAR2(20) PRIMARY KEY, branch_city VARCHAR2(20), assets REAL);
```
```bash
CREATE TABLE ACCOUNT(accno NUMBER(12,0) PRIMARY KEY, branch_name VARCHAR2(20), balance REAL);
```
```bash
CREATE TABLE DEPOSITOR(customer_name VARCHAR2(20), accno NUMBER(12,0));
```
```bash
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER(customer_name VARCHAR2(20),customer_street VARCHAR2(20), customer_city VARCHAR2(20));
```
```bash
CREATE TABLE LOAN(loan_number NUMBER(12,0) PRIMARY KEY, branch_name VARCHAR2(20), amount REAL);
```
```bash
CREATE TABLE BORROWER(customer_name VARCHAR2(20),loan_number NUMBER(12,0));
```

##### *You can also define foreign keys(constraints)/primarys here, But I will add some of Primary keys & foreign keys using 'ALTER' command.*


##  Adding FOREIGN KEYS in remaining Tables:

##### *This commands will help you alter tables constraints like primary keys & foreign keys.*

```bash
ALTER TABLE ACCOUNT ADD CONSTRAINT fk_branch_name1 FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES BRANCH (branch_name);
```
```bash
ALTER TABLE DEPOSITOR ADD CONSTRAINT fk_accno FOREIGN KEY (accno) REFERENCES ACCOUNT (accno);
```
```bash
ALTER TABLE DEPOSITOR  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer_name FOREIGN KEY(customer_name) REFERENCES CUSTOMER (customer_name);
```
```bash
ALTER TABLE LOAN ADD CONSTRAINT fk_branch_name2 FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES BRANCH (branch_name);
```
```bash
ALTER TABLE BORROWER ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer_name FOREIGN KEY (customer_name) REFERENCES CUSTOMER (customer_name);
```
```bash
ALTER TABLE BORROWER ADD CONSTRAINT fk_loan_number FOREIGN KEY (loan_number) REFERENCES LOAN (loan_number);
```


##  Adding PRIMARY KEY with Two or More Columns:

##### *This commands will help you add primary keys on the remaining tables with two or more columns.* 
#### *"To make each row UNIQUE"*

```bash
ALTER TABLE DEPOSITOR ADD CONSTRAINT pk_depositor PRIMARY KEY (customer_name, accno);
```
```bash
ALTER TABLE BORROWER ADD CONSTRAINT pk_borrower PRIMARY KEY (customer_name, loan_number);

```

##  Setting Constraints 'ON DELETE':

##### *This commands is important because it will decide what to do if we DELETE record from a table(parent) whose column is a foreign key of another table (important for solving last question).* 
#### *"SET NULL ---> will set the value null."*
#### *"CASCADE ---> will delete the value corresponding to foreign key."*

```bash
ALTER TABLE ACCOUNT 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_account_branch 
FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) 
REFERENCES BRANCH (branch_name)
ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

##  Inserting Data in Tables:

##### *This commands will INSERT data in the pre-defined tables.* 

#### *"INSERT one by one"* 

```bash
UPCOMING.........
```

#### *"INSERT multiple rows at once"* 

```bash
UPCOMING.........
```

#### *"INSERT data having type DATE: (multiple rows)"* 

```bash
UPCOMING.........
```

##  UPDATE Data in Tables:

```bash
UPCOMING.........

```

#### *"Oracle Queries are not case sensitive"* 

```bash
UPCOMING.........

```

##  EXTRACTING the desired information from Tables:

#### *"Remember I have used these commands as per my research and knowledge, you can apply different approach to solve the same problem, It is Recommended to try by yourself."*
**Here I have used 'WHERE' clause to solve the 2nd last problems, you can use 'JOIN' statements or any other approach.**

```bash
UPCOMING.........

```
